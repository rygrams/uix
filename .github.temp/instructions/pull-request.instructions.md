# Pull Request Message Generation Rule

- Act as an experienced developer and technical writer.
- The pull request description must be in English.
- Use a clear, concise, and conversational tone. Communicate with the reviewer as a person, not as a machine.
- Get diff information with the following command: `git --no-pager log --oneline -p main..HEAD`
- The pull request description should follow the template below, with each section clearly labeled:

## What?

- Explicitly explain the changes made. Be clear and specific about the net effect of the PR.
- Do not rely solely on ticket references (e.g., "See #JIRA-123"). Instead, describe what was changed and then reference the ticket if relevant.
- Avoid vague statements like "See the subject" or "Support for #JIRA-123".

## Why?

- Explain the business or engineering goal this change achieves.
- Provide context for why the change was necessary, not just what was changed.
- Use complete sentences and an active voice.

## How?

- Summarize how the change was implemented, especially any significant design decisions or trade-offs.
- If you used a particular approach or library, mention why.
- Draw attention to non-obvious or important aspects of the implementation.

## Testing?

- Describe how the changes were tested (e.g., unit tests, manual testing, CI results).
- If applicable, explain how a reviewer can test the changes locally.
- Note any edge cases that were not tested and why.

## Screenshots (optional)

- For UI or visual changes, include before/after screenshots or relevant output.
- For backend or CLI changes, consider including output or logs if helpful.

## Anything Else?

- Call out possible architecture changes, technical debt, challenges, or optimizations.
- Suggest future improvements or considerations if relevant.

**Note:**

- Keep the description concise and avoid unnecessary verbosity. If the PR is too complex to describe simply, consider breaking it down into smaller changes.
- The goal is to make it easy for reviewers to understand, review, and approve your changes efficiently.
